You might have seen the [headlines in the past few weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/apr/29/shelter-forecasts-rise-number-of-children-short-term-housing-2029-temporary-accommodation), about the crisis in council finances linked to the rising costs of providing temporary accommodation. In the UK local authorities have a "prevention duty", a statutory obligation to mitigate people becoming homeless. Historically, the typical state intervention would be to find suitable social housing in the local area. However, increasingly local authorities don't have enough social housing available, and are instead placing people in accommodation the council leases from the private sector. This accommodation can range from privately rented flats, to hotels or hostels. In 2024, over 80,000 people in the UK were assessed as being owed a prevention duty, leading to some areas spending over 20% of their total council budget on securing temporary accommodation; aggravating the finances of councils already on the [brink of bankruptcy](https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/south-east-council-on-brink-of-bankruptcy-over-massive-rise-in-homelessness-costs-82901).



Aside from the financial cost, the type of shelter provided as temporary accommodation has been heavily criticised. Firstly, it is often not temporary, with people stuck in this accommodation limbo for years. Secondly, the accommodation is often not suitable for habitation, with notable examples lacking space, cooking facilities, or even [windows](https://news.sky.com/story/windowless-rooms-and-insect-infestations-domestic-abuse-victims-forced-to-live-in-traumatising-properties-12592101) making the news. This is perhaps particularly disturbing considering that in 2024, 25% of households owed a relief duty were families with children.
