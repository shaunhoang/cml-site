abstract: Social media is used nowadays for various location-based applications and
  services, aspiring to use the vast and timely potential of user-generated content.
  To evaluate the correctness, reliability and potential of these applications and
  services, they are mostly evaluated in terms of optimization or compared to existing
  authoritative data sources and services. With respect to route planning, criterion
  optimization is mostly implemented to evaluate the service effectiveness, in terms
  of, e.g., length, time or visited places. These evaluations are mostly limited in
  their effectiveness at presenting the complete experience of the route, since they
  are limited to a predefined criterion and are mostly implemented in two-dimensional
  space. In this research, we propose a comprehensive evaluation process, in which
  a tourism walking route is analyzed with respect to three-dimensional visibility
  that measures the attractiveness of the route relating to the user perception. To
  present our development, we showcase the use of Flickr, a social media photo-sharing
  online website that is popular among travelers that share their tourism experiences.
  We use Flickr photos to generate tourism walking routes and evaluate them in terms
  of the visible space. We show that the 3D visibility analysis identifies the various
  visible urban elements in the vicinity of the tourism routes, which are more attractive,
  scenery and include many tourism attractions. Since urban attractivity is often
  reflected in the photo-trails of Flickr photographers, we argue that using 3D visibility
  analysis that measures urban attractiveness and scenery should be considered for
  the purpose of analysis and evaluation of location-based services.
