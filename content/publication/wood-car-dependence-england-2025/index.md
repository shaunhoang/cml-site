abstract: This paper explores the nuances of car dependence in England and Wales by
  identifying four distinct archetypes that span structural and conscious forms. Employing
  the 2011 England and Wales Census, archetype prevalence is mapped across the study
  area at the LSOA level, and a demographic analysis is performed. We find that, while
  dependence exists across the study area, structural dependence is found more in
  rural areas, particularly the east coast of England and Wales, while conscious dependence
  is more prevalent in and around urban centres. The demographic makeup of each archetype
  differs significantly, with disability, socio-economic class, and ethnicity arising
  as notable significant indicators. This work highlights that an equitable transition
  to a sustainable transport system requires geographically and demographically specific
  policies tailored to the unique needs of each archetype. This transition away from
  car dependence, especially internal combustion engine vehicles, is imperative for
  a just and climate-resilient transport system.
