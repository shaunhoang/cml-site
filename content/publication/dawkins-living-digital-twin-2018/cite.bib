 abstract = {The concept of Digital Twin is becoming increasingly popular with researchers and professionals in the AEC industries as a means of visualising, modelling and working with complex urban systems. This is achieved through the coupling of physical systems with comprehensive digital representations that automatically update to match the state of their physical counterpart. Using real-time data from IoT technologies and advanced 3D visualisation this research conducts a practical investigation into the process of creating and working with a Digital Twin of the new UCL Campus at Here East on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.},
