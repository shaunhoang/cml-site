abstract: The concept of Digital Twin is becoming increasingly popular with researchers
  and professionals in the AEC industries as a means of visualising, modelling and
  working with complex urban systems. This is achieved through the coupling of physical
  systems with comprehensive digital representations that automatically update to
  match the state of their physical counterpart. Using real-time data from IoT technologies
  and advanced 3D visualisation this research conducts a practical investigation into
  the process of creating and working with a Digital Twin of the new UCL Campus at
  Here East on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
