abstract: Transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions account for an increasing
  proportion of total emissions in the UK and globally. The provision of rail transit
  is popularly proposed to reduce transport GHG emissions, but the provision of new
  infrastructure is itself GHG intensive. Understanding of the GHG emissions impact
  of rail projects is limited and very few longitudinal studies have been carried
  out. Existing assessments are often limited both in their scope and the factors
  considered. A holistic understanding of GHG impacts must include an assessment of
  capital GHG emissions, operational energy and maintenance as well as an assessment
  of ridership mode shift and mode share impacts and the relationship between transit
  infrastructure and land use. This paper explores rail infrastructure projects and
  their associated GHG emissions. Guidance is given on the aspects of rail planning,
  design and construction that must be considered to more fully understand the associated
  GHG impacts.
