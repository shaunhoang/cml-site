abstract: Discrete Choice Analysis presents these results in such a way that they
  are fully accessible to the range of students and professionals who are involved
  in modelling demand and consumer behavior in general or specifically in transportation
  - whether from the point of view of the design of transit systems, urban and transport
  economics, public policy, operations research, or systems management and planning.
  The methods of discrete choice analysis and their applications in the modelling
  of transportation systems constitute a comparatively new field that has largely
  evolved over the past 15 years. Since its inception, however, the field has developed
  rapidly, and this is the first text and reference work to cover the material systematically,
  bringing together the scattered and often inaccessible results for graduate students
  and professionals. Discrete Choice Analysis presents these results in such a way
  that they are fully accessible to the range of students and professionals who are
  involved in modelling demand and consumer behavior in general or specifically in
  transportation - whether from the point of view of the design of transit systems,
  urban and transport economics, public policy, operations research, or systems management
  and planning. The introductory chapter presents the background of discrete choice
  analysis and context of transportation demand forecasting. Subsequent chapters cover,
  among other topics, the theories of individual choice behavior, binary and multinomial
  choice models, aggregate forecasting techniques, estimation methods, tests used
  in the process of model development, sampling theory, the nested-logit model, and
  systems of models. Discrete Choice Analysis is ninth in the MIT Press Series in
  Transportation Studies, edited by Marvin Manheim.
