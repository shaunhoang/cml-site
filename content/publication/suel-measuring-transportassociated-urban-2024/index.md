abstract: Reducing urban inequalities is at the forefront of the global sustainable
  development agenda, as well as national and local policies. While existing measures
  of inequality are mostly focused on income and wealth, it is widely recognised that
  non-monetary disparities such as in health, education, and housing play a crucial
  role in creating and reinforcing inequalities. Transport plays a central role in
  mitigating inequalities by enhancing access to employment, education, and essential
  services. It is also directly and indirectly related to disparities in housing,
  neighbourhoods, and health. Policymakers increasingly recognize the potential of
  transport policies in addressing inequalities; however, the effects of interventions
  need to be understood beyond the transport sector only and should consider wider
  impacts. In this review, we concentrate on three interlinked sectors -- housing,
  land-use, and transportation -- where local governments possess some capacity to
  influence the processes by which inequalities are created and exacerbated. Currently,
  empirical research on inequalities within these domains is fragmented. Models and
  datasets used for scenario testing, planning, and intervention evaluation are often
  disjointed, sector-focused, and rarely consider distributional effects. Our aim
  is to critically review the literature across different disciplines and perspectives
  and propose future interdisciplinary directions towards better measurement and modelling
  of transport-associated inequalities.
