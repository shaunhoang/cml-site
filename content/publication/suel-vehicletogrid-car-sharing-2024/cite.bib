 abstract = {Combining vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with car sharing can substantially contribute to decarbonization of both energy and transportation sectors. Car-sharing users' booking slot flexibility is crucial for integration yet remains underexplored. We developed an integrated choice and latent variable model to estimate the value of financial incentives needed for shifting slots and how it is affected by socio-demographics, latent attitudes, trip-level characteristics. We conducted a stated preference survey with car sharing users in Switzerland. The value of time in our sample ranged between 22.4 CHF/h and 35.5 CHF/h (23.5 USD/h and 37.2 USD/h). Older adults, lower income groups, individuals in employment and with a university degree had lower time flexibility. Work, leisure, trips involving others, trips taking place during weekdays and morning peaks were harder to alter. This flexibility has the potential to encourage car-sharing operators and users to engage in V2G initiatives, contributing to decarbonization of transportation and energy systems.},
