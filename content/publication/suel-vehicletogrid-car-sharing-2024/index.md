abstract: Combining vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with car sharing can substantially contribute
  to decarbonization of both energy and transportation sectors. Car-sharing users'
  booking slot flexibility is crucial for integration yet remains underexplored. We
  developed an integrated choice and latent variable model to estimate the value of
  financial incentives needed for shifting slots and how it is affected by socio-demographics,
  latent attitudes, trip-level characteristics. We conducted a stated preference survey
  with car sharing users in Switzerland. The value of time in our sample ranged between
  22.4 CHF/h and 35.5 CHF/h (23.5 USD/h and 37.2 USD/h). Older adults, lower income
  groups, individuals in employment and with a university degree had lower time flexibility.
  Work, leisure, trips involving others, trips taking place during weekdays and morning
  peaks were harder to alter. This flexibility has the potential to encourage car-sharing
  operators and users to engage in V2G initiatives, contributing to decarbonization
  of transportation and energy systems.
