abstract: Cities around the world are grappling with multiple interconnected challenges,
  including population growth, shortage of affordable and decent housing, and the
  need for neighborhood improvements. Despite its critical importance for policy,
  our ability to effectively monitor and track urban change remains limited. Deep
  learning-based computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been
  successful in the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but
  did not fully utilize temporal images to track urban change, as time-varying labels
  are often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London
  using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel adaptation
  of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being invariant to seasonal
  and daily changes without manual annotations. It outperformed generic pretrained
  embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in London's housing supply
  from street-level images, and distinguished between major and minor change. This
  capability can provide timely information for urban planning and policy decisions
  towards more liveable, equitable, and sustainable cities.
