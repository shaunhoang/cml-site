abstract: Transport is a complex system, integral to national and international structure
  and without which society cannot function. At the same time, transport is a significant
  contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. In the UK a step change is required
  in the transport sector to achieve the legally binding reduction targets of the
  Climate Change Act 2008. Following the UK government's 2013 review of carbon dioxide
  emissions from infrastructure, this paper looks at the country's present and projected
  transport emissions in the context of the transport status quo and plans for growth.
  It argues there is an urgent need to rebalance the transport modal mix, with all
  modes integrated into a seamless transport system with smart interfacing between
  them. Drivers for behavioural change are also essential.
