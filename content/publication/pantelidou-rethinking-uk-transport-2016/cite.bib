 abstract = {Transport is a complex system, integral to national and international structure and without which society cannot function. At the same time, transport is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. In the UK a step change is required in the transport sector to achieve the legally binding reduction targets of the Climate Change Act 2008. Following the UK government's 2013 review of carbon dioxide emissions from infrastructure, this paper looks at the country's present and projected transport emissions in the context of the transport status quo and plans for growth. It argues there is an urgent need to rebalance the transport modal mix, with all modes integrated into a seamless transport system with smart interfacing between them. Drivers for behavioural change are also essential.},
