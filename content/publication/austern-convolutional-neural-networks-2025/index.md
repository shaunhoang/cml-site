abstract: Urban density, along with the associated urban morphology and topology,
  significantly influences human perception, emotions, and behavior, ultimately affecting
  our overall well-being. Over the past decades, experts have developed spatial analysis
  models and tools which evaluate how planning and design impact urban residents and
  the functionality of cities. One such spatial analyses model is the Urban Spatial
  Openness Index (USOI) which utilizes ray-casting to conduct 3D visibility analysis
  predicting the perceived density of entire cities on a macro-scale, represented
  as 2D heatmaps. In the urban scale, ray-casting analysis is computationally intense
  and requires significant resources, which hinders its effective application. In
  this paper, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a model to predict
  perceived density in urban fabrics based on 2D heatmap images. The processes described
  in this paper include creating a dataset of corresponding USOI images and height
  images from several different cities, training a CNN model, and evaluating the model's
  performance. The model predicts USOI with a mean absolute error of 1.92~%, which
  is considered highly accurate for visual perception on the urban scale. This study
  showcases the capability of CNN models to predict perceived density as measured
  by the USOI. The use of a predictive model can significantly reduce the processing
  time of 3D visibility analysis on the urban scale.
