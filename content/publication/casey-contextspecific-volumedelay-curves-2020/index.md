abstract: Traffic congestion across the world has reached chronic levels. Despite
  many technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used functions
  within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little in the way
  of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally macroscopic methods
  have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular journey time. The general
  nature of these functions enables their ease of use and gives widespread applicability.
  However, they lack the ability to consider individual road characteristics (i.e.
  geometry, presence of traffic furniture, road quality and surrounding environment).
  This research investigates the feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different
  data sources, namely the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application
  Programming Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters
  (ATC). Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global
  Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time, context-specific
  traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs enable the harvesting of
  the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal resolutions (hourly or less).
  By combining them for different road types in London, new context-specific volume-delay
  functions can be generated. This method shows promise in selected locations with
  the generation of robust functions. In other locations it highlights the need to
  better understand other influencing factors, such as the presence of on road parking
  or weather events.
