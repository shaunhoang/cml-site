abstract: 'Agent-Based Model (ABM) is a promising tool for city-scale traffic simulation
  to understand the complex behaviour of the entire urban transportation system under
  different scenarios. In the ABM, traffic is intuitively simulated as movements and
  interactions between large numbers of agents, each capable of finding the route
  for an individual traveller or vehicle. This paper presents such an ABM development
  to reproduce the traffic patterns of the city of San Francisco. The model features
  a detailed road network and hour-long simulation time step to capture realistic
  variations in traffic conditions. Agent speed is determined according to a simplified
  volume-delay macroscopic relationship, which is more efficient than applying microscopic
  rules (e.g., car following) for evaluating city-scale traffic conditions. Two particular
  challenges of building such an ABM are addressed in this paper: data availability
  and computational cost. The key inputs to the ABM are sourced from standard and
  publicly available datasets, including the travel demand surveys published by local
  transport authorities and the road network data from the OpenStreetMap. In addition,
  an efficient priority-queue based Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to overcome
  the computational bottleneck of agent routing. The ABM is designed to run on High
  Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, thereby improving the computational speed
  significantly. Preliminary validation of the ABM is conducted by comparing its results
  with a published model. Overall, the ABM has been demonstrated to run efficiently
  and produce reliable results.'
