abstract: "Cities are home to an increasing majority of the world's population. Currently,
  it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in
  cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding
  urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring
  spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment,
  health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images
  without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance
  of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London
  using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We
  then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles
  for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was
  achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least
  successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health).
  We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major
  cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis
  showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1% of images in other
  cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities
  themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement
  traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban
  surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim
  to address them."
