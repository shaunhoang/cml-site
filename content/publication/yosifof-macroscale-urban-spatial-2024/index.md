abstract: "Urban morphologies play a crucial role in influencing pedestrians' visual
  perception and spatial experience. Their effects can be quantified using metrics
  such as Isovists and additional visibility analyses. The Spatial Openness Index
  (SOI) is one such analysis tool, predicting perceived density---a key influencer
  of well-being in dense urban settings. Higher SOI values correspond to greater perceived
  openness and lower perceived density. SOI measurements have been correlated with
  pedestrian well-being indexes and extensively tested through experiments in virtual
  reality (VR) environments. The SOI model employs 3D ray-casting in urban 3D models.
  To extend this micro-scale analysis to a macro-scale, the SOI model has been updated
  and is now referred to as the Urban Spatial Openness Index (USOI) model. The developed
  methodology involves performing perceived density analysis on an urban scale, by
  deploying a 5x5m analysis grid in open spaces, unoccupied by buildings. The analysis
  results are presented as heatmaps, visualizing the perceived density of open spaces.
  The use of the model is demonstrated by analyzing nine diverse urban fabrics, varying
  in morphology, density, and design traditions in three cities: New York City, Tel
  Aviv and Zurich. USOI results for different urban morphologies provide insights
  into the relationships between various morphologies and their respective perceived
  density of open spaces. This reinforces the understanding of human spatial experience
  regarding perceived density on a macro scale. The analysis of varying morphologies
  could potentially contribute to future datasets of visibility and perceived density,
  serving as a valuable resource for practitioners and researchers."
