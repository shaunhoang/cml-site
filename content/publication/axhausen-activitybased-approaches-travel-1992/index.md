abstract: Recent policy discussions about information technology in transport and
  traffic demand management have increased interest in activity-based approaches to
  the analysis of travel behaviour, in particular in the modelling of household activity
  scheduling which is at the core of many of the required changes in travel behaviour.
  This paper is a state-of-the-art review of conceptualizations and models of activity
  scheduling with special regard to issues raised by the new policy instruments. In
  the course of the review, the validity of behavioural assumptions is examined critically
  and several needs for future research identified.
