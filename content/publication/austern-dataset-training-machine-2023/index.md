abstract: Previous studies have described the effects of urban attributes such as
  the Spatial Openness Index (SOI) on pedestrians' experience. SOI uses 3-dimensional
  ray casting to quantify the volume of visible space from a single viewpoint. The
  higher the SOI value, the higher the perceived openness and the lower the perceived
  density. However, the ray casting simulation on an urban-sized sampling grid is
  computationally intensive, making this method difficult to use in real-time design
  tools. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have excellent performance in computer
  vision in image processing applications. They can be trained to predict the SOI
  analysis for large urban fabrics in real-time. However, these supervised learning
  models need a substantial amount of labeled data to train on. For this purpose,
  we developed a method to generate a large series of height maps and SOI maps of
  urban fabrics in New York City and encoded them as images using colour information.
  These height map - SOI analysis image pairs can be used as training data for a CNN
  to provide rapid, precise visibility simulations on an urban scale.
