abstract: Engineers have begun to take interest in the interface between the structures
  they build and the people that use them. This has resulted in a need to better understand
  behavioural decision making at the micro scale. An analysis was carried out on the
  London Travel Demand Survey in order to see what behavioural rules could be derived
  from the survey data. This analysis attempted to relate the financial cost and time
  cost of a journey to the socio-economic status of a traveller in order to see what
  relationship existed. Relating this empirical exhibited data to real-world data
  is challenging. Crowd sourced big-data avenues were explored in order to derive
  realistic information that considers factors such as traffic congestion, service
  time tables and the underlying complexity of the London transport network. It was
  hypothesised that the socio-economic status of the traveller, the distance and the
  motivation of the journey would impact on traveller decision making. However, no
  statistically significant results were found. It is concluded that the use of crude
  small sample size survey data to analyse fine grained crowd-sourced data is inappropriate
  and highlights a critical need to find other means of recording actual traveller
  decisions in order to understand the decision making process better. Such insights
  are critical if better strategic decisions are to be made on transport infrastructure.
