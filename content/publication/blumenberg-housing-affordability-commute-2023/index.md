abstract: "The growing affordable housing crisis in high-cost metropolitan areas may
  force households to seek lower cost housing in the outer reaches of metropolitan
  areas contributing to the recent increase in commute distance. To explore this assertion,
  we test the relationship between the availability of affordable housing relative
  to jobs and commute distance in two diverse metropolitan statistical areas in Southern
  California: Los Angeles-Orange (higher cost, coastal, older, more urban) and Riverside-San
  Bernardino (lower cost, inland, newer, more suburban). A worse ``fit'' between the
  number of low-wage jobs and affordable housing rentals is associated with longer
  commute distances in LA-Orange, but is not statistically significant in Riverside-San
  Bernardino. This study's findings highlight the differences in housing dynamics
  and commute distances between higher cost coastal regions and lower cost inland
  regions---and underscore the importance of protecting and expanding the supply of
  affordable housing in job-rich neighborhoods located in more expensive, coastal
  cities."
