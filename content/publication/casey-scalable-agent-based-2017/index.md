abstract: This paper presents a framework for using real-time big-data to inform a
  transport Agent Based Model (ABM) for a range of scenario testing applications.
  Computational advances have enabled for increasingly complex, bottom-up, fine resolution
  simulations to be carried out over long time horizons at fine spatial and temporal
  resolution. This has hinted at the possibility of connecting scales of what has
  been historically been fine resolution operational models and coarse resolution
  strategic models. The value of any fine resolution dynamic model is limited by the
  quality of its inputs. The wave of new geospatially connected devices has enabled
  the harvesting of fine resolution spatial and temporal data on travellers' and even
  the infrastructure itself. This crowd-sourced data can be used to inform dynamic
  models with real-world and real-time data, bypassing the need for generalised functions
  and/or expensive survey data. In this paper, Google Directions API data and Transport
  for London data feeds are presented in a framework for London. The use of decentralised
  data structures is also presented and comment is made on the possibilities of using
  parallel computing advances in Computer Science to scaling up fine resolution scenario
  testing transportation models and enabling support for a range of agent decision
  making methodologies. Such data structures offer performance improvements in the
  storing of dynamic data that may be manipulated in order to simulate local and global
  hard infrastructure scenarios alone or in tandem with traditional policy or dynamic
  policy making scenarios.
