abstract: 'The current state of practice for transportation equity analysis is moving
  toward the use of activity-based travel models for scenario analysis. However, little
  has been done to validate the use of these models for equity analysis. The first
  objective of this paper is to present a research framework for the equity analysis
  of long-range transportation plans, for the purpose of critiquing the current state
  of practice and pointing to key research needs. This research framework is used
  to identify four research areas for furthering transportation equity analysis: (a)
  identifying transportation priorities for different groups of interest, (b) identifying
  appropriate modeling tools for measuring equity outcomes, (c) identifying and analyzing
  equity indicators, and (d) linking the equity indicators and the transportation
  priorities. The second objective is to explore how well an activity-based travel
  demand model represents heterogeneity of travel behavior among different income
  classes, for the purpose of transportation equity analysis. Graphical and statistical
  tools are used to access how well a sample of the model data compares with a sample
  of travel survey data for the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The results
  show that although the tests of distribution equality fail, the general shape of
  the distributions, the central tendencies, and the relative difference of the low-
  versus high-income samples perform well.'
