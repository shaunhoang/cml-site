abstract: Neighbourhoods are fundamental spatial units to present social phenomena
  in urban studies. Many studies use administrative boundaries such as census tracts
  as representations of neighbourhoods, but such boundaries may poorly represent the
  underlying social structures and physical attributes which might help define more
  vernacular conceptions and dialectical evolution of these zones. In this paper,
  using the goal of creating a new set of `Strategic Neighbourhoods' for Transport
  for London (TfL) as vehicle for analysis, we evaluate two contrasting spatially
  and socially focused methodologies of neighbourhood generation. In comparing the
  outputs of a tertiary-communities (T-Communities) method and a combined Principal
  Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) cluster analysis method
  with an earlier iteration of Strategic Neighbourhoods defined by TfL, indices including
  neighbourhood size, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and the number of
  community centres are calculated to evaluate their relative performance which demonstrate
  that both methods create neighbourhood boundaries that can better capture intra-group
  social homogeneity and are more suitable for analysis than the original SNA boundaries.
  These results are discussed in the context of the dialectic relationship between
  neighbourhood outcomes, spatial structures, and social characteristics, leading
  to more widely relevant conclusions that neighbourhood boundary delineation should
  combine spatial structure, social attributes, and experimental knowledge to effectively
  sub-divide urban activity.
