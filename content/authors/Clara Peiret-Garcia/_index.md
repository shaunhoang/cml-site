I'm a Research Fellow in Urban Analytics at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), working on the TRACK-UK project. My research focuses on understanding the diversity of human mobility, mainly how people navigate urban spaces in fundamentally different ways. Rather than looking at the "average" traveler, I dig into how travel behaviors vary across individuals and populations, exploring the spatial distribution of these distinct patterns. 

I'm particularly interested in how people engage in their daily activities, and how this results into different activity chains that vary from person to person. A central question driving my work is: how well do transport systems actually accommodate this diversity of travel and activity patterns? Where do they fall short? What inequalities derive from this mismatch? Methodologically, I work primarily with survey data, though I'm open to exploring any mobility-related data source.
