I am a postdoc in CASA, working on the Smart Cities theme as part of the AI for Collective Intelligence (AI4CI) hub. My current research focuses on using machine learning methods to analyse how London's built environment is changing. Recently I've been using natural language processing to develop a data-driven characterisation of responses to planning applications. 

I'm interesting in the application of computational methods to address real world problems, with a focus on how quantitative findings can inform policy. My PhD studies were completed in the Computer Science department, UCL, where my research focussed on developing computational models to gain a deeper understanding of disease progression in dementia. I completed both my undergraduate and integrated master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Warwick. 

I like to take an interdisciplinary approach to my work. Of late I've been enjoying learning about the mathematics of generative models, as well as the theory of spatial inequality. Beyond my research activities I also do some teaching, lecturing on the CASA masters course Quantitative Methods. I'm interested in outreach and science communication - during my PhD I was involved in women in STEM initiatives, and edited the Maths magazine Chalkdust.
