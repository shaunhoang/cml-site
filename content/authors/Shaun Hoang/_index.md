Shaun Hoang (The-Huan)'s research focuses on improving equitable and sustainable access and transport resilience in fast-growing cities, particularly in the Global South. He is interested in combining complexity science and spatial data analysis to study first/last-mile access and transport resilience, using open geodata, simulation, and machine learning methods. His experience includes predicting trip attraction with ML and supporting traffic simulations in low-data contexts.
