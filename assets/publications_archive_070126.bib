  abstract = {Agent based modelling is a modelling paradigm which may transform how key policy decisions are made. Agent Based Models (ABMs) simulate actions and interactions of agents with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. They aim to provide insight into complex behaviour and simulate collective behaviour of agents, often by obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems. Their specific use in transportation and city scale modelling is documented in research but has only recently being looked at for real-world applications and decision-making due to a range of reasons, such as a lack of available data and computational infrastructure. Questions such as "What are the equity impacts of this transport scheme?" or "Will my policy decision have a detrimental impact on those who have to travel?" or "How does this decision affect the network outside the traditional peaks?" are difficult to answer with existing modelling tools. Furthermore, future mobility modes, such as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, and frameworks, such as Mobility as a Service, pose further challenges to existing modelling tools. ABMs lend themselves well to tackling these questions and scenarios because of the agent level interaction, heuristic decision making, continuous modelling, and the vast socio-demographic data that can sit behind each agent (individual). In late 2018, Arup and TfL engaged in a collaborative effort to explore the development of a proof of concept ABM for London. This was based on previous work Arup carried out for Transport Victoria in Australia, where the team built a city-wide ABM of Melbourne using an open source framework, MATSim and on TfL's work on population synthesis and activity based plan estimation. The joint team developed a synthetic population and built a UK-wide network to simulate travel over 24 hours in London. One of the key objectives of the collaboration was knowledge-share as well as learning. This paper sets out the fundamental principles behind ABMs, their potential application in answering difficult policy questions and the methodology, learnings and outcomes from the Arup/TfL collaboration.},

  abstract = {Traffic congestion across the world has reached chronic levels. Despite many technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used functions within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little in the way of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally macroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular journey time. The general nature of these functions enables their ease of use and gives widespread applicability. However, they lack the ability to consider individual road characteristics (i.e. geometry, presence of traffic furniture, road quality and surrounding environment). This research investigates the feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different data sources, namely the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application Programming Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters (ATC). Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time, context-specific traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs enable the harvesting of the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal resolutions (hourly or less). By combining them for different road types in London, new context-specific volume-delay functions can be generated. This method shows promise in selected locations with the generation of robust functions. In other locations it highlights the need to better understand other influencing factors, such as the presence of on road parking or weather events.},

Computational advances have enabled for increasingly complex, bottom-up, fine resolution simulations to be carried out over long time horizons at fine spatial and temporal resolution. This has hinted at the possibility of connecting scales of what has been historically been fine resolution operational models and coarse resolution strategic models. The value of any fine resolution dynamic model is limited by the quality of its inputs. The wave of new geospatially connected devices has enabled the harvesting of fine resolution spatial and temporal data on travellers' and even the infrastructure itself. This crowd-sourced data can be used to inform dynamic models with real-world and real-time data, bypassing the need for generalised functions and/or expensive survey data. In this paper, Google Directions API data and Transport for London data feeds are presented in a framework for London. The use of decentralised data structures is also presented and comment is made on the possibilities of using parallel computing advances in Computer Science to scaling up fine resolution scenario testing transportation models and enabling support for a range of agent decision making methodologies. Such data structures offer performance improvements in the storing of dynamic data that may be manipulated in order to simulate local and global hard infrastructure scenarios alone or in tandem with traditional policy or dynamic policy making scenarios.},

This has resulted in a need to better understand behavioural decision making at the micro scale. An analysis was carried out on the London Travel Demand Survey in order to see what behavioural rules could be derived from the survey data. This analysis attempted to relate the financial cost and time cost of a journey to the socio-economic status of a traveller in order to see what relationship existed. Relating this empirical exhibited data to real-world data is challenging. Crowd sourced big-data avenues were explored in order to derive realistic information that considers factors such as traffic congestion, service time tables and the underlying complexity of the London transport network. It was hypothesised that the socio-economic status of the traveller, the distance and the motivation of the journey would impact on traveller decision making. However, no statistically significant results were found. It is concluded that the use of crude small sample size survey data to analyse fine grained crowd-sourced data is inappropriate and highlights a critical need to find other means of recording actual traveller decisions in order to understand the decision making process better. Such insights are critical if better strategic decisions are to be made on transport infrastructure.},

We found that, on average, public transport accessibility in London has increased over the past decade, with 78\% of LSOAs experiencing improvements. Public transport accessibility in London showed an unequal distribution in cross-sectional analyses. Lower income neighbourhoods had poorer accessibility to public transportation in 2011 and 2023 after controlling for car-ownership and population density. These disparities were particularly pronounced for underground accessibility. Temporal analyses revealed that existing inequalities with respect to income deprivation and ethnicity are generally not improving. While wealthier groups benefited most from London Underground service improvements; lower income groups benefited more from bus service improvements.

It argues there is an urgent need to rebalance the transport modal mix, with all modes integrated into a seamless transport system with smart interfacing between them.

The provision of rail transit is popularly proposed to reduce transport GHG emissions, but the provision of new infrastructure is itself GHG intensive. Understanding of the GHG emissions impact of rail projects is limited and very few longitudinal studies have been carried out. Existing assessments are often limited both in their scope and the factors considered. A holistic understanding of GHG impacts must include an assessment of capital GHG emissions, operational energy and maintenance as well as an assessment of ridership mode shift and mode share impacts and the relationship between transit infrastructure and land use. This paper explores rail infrastructure projects and their associated GHG emissions. Guidance is given on the aspects of rail planning, design and construction that must be considered to more fully understand the associated GHG impacts.}

Deep learning-based computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been successful in the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but did not fully utilize temporal images to track urban change, as time-varying labels are often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel adaptation of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being invariant to seasonal and daily changes without manual annotations. It outperformed generic pretrained embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in London's housing supply from street-level images, and distinguished between major and minor change. This capability can provide timely information for urban planning and policy decisions towards more liveable, equitable, and sustainable cities.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

While existing measures of inequality are mostly focused on income and wealth, it is widely recognised that non-monetary disparities such as in health, education, and housing play a crucial role in creating and reinforcing inequalities. Transport plays a central role in mitigating inequalities by enhancing access to employment, education, and essential services. It is also directly and indirectly related to disparities in housing, neighbourhoods, and health. Policymakers increasingly recognize the potential of transport policies in addressing inequalities; however, the effects of interventions need to be understood beyond the transport sector only and should consider wider impacts. In this review, we concentrate on three interlinked sectors -- housing, land-use, and transportation -- where local governments possess some capacity to influence the processes by which inequalities are created and exacerbated. Currently, empirical research on inequalities within these domains is fragmented. Models and datasets used for scenario testing, planning, and intervention evaluation are often disjointed, sector-focused, and rarely consider distributional effects. Our aim is to critically review the literature across different disciplines and perspectives and propose future interdisciplinary directions towards better measurement and modelling of transport-associated inequalities.},

Multiple types of data from different sources are often available for a given geographic area. Yet, most studies utilize a single type of input data when making measurements due to methodological difficulties in their joint use. We propose two deep learning-based methods for jointly utilizing satellite and street level imagery for measuring urban inequalities. We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9\% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3~m~\texttimes ~3~m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street-level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11\%. We also show examples of prediction maps from both approaches to visually highlight performance differences.},

In this paper, using the goal of creating a new set of "Strategic Neighbourhoods" for Transport for London (TfL) as vehicle for analysis, we evaluate two contrasting spatially and socially focused methodologies of neighbourhood generation. In comparing the outputs of a tertiary-communities (T-Communities) method and a combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) cluster analysis method with an earlier iteration of Strategic Neighbourhoods defined by TfL, indices including neighbourhood size, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and the number of community centres are calculated to evaluate their relative performance which demonstrate that both methods create neighbourhood boundaries that can better capture intra-group social homogeneity and are more suitable for analysis than the original SNA boundaries. These results are discussed in the context of the dialectic relationship between neighbourhood outcomes, spatial structures, and social characteristics, leading to more widely relevant conclusions that neighbourhood boundary delineation should combine spatial structure, social attributes, and experimental knowledge to effectively sub-divide urban activity.},

In the ABM, traffic is intuitively simulated as movements and interactions between large numbers of agents, each capable of finding the route for an individual traveller or vehicle. This paper presents such an ABM development to reproduce the traffic patterns of the city of San Francisco. The model features a detailed road network and hour-long simulation time step to capture realistic variations in traffic conditions. Agent speed is determined according to a simplified volume-delay macroscopic relationship, which is more efficient than applying microscopic rules (e.g., car following) for evaluating city-scale traffic conditions. Two particular challenges of building such an ABM are addressed in this paper: data availability and computational cost. The key inputs to the ABM are sourced from standard and publicly available datasets, including the travel demand surveys published by local transport authorities and the road network data from the OpenStreetMap. In addition, an efficient priority-queue based Dijkstra algorithm is implemented to overcome the computational bottleneck of agent routing. The ABM is designed to run on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, thereby improving the computational speed significantly. Preliminary validation of the ABM is conducted by comparing its results with a published model. Overall, the ABM has been demonstrated to run efficiently and produce reliable results.},

  abstract = {Cities around the world are grappling with multiple interconnected challenges, including population growth, shortage of affordable and decent housing, and the need for neighborhood improvements. Despite its critical importance for policy, our ability to effectively monitor and track urban change remains limited. Deep learning-based computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been successful in the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but did not fully utilize temporal images to track urban change, as time-varying labels are often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel adaptation of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being invariant to seasonal and daily changes without manual annotations. It outperformed generic pretrained embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in London's housing supply from street-level images, and distinguished between major and minor change. This capability can provide timely information for urban planning and policy decisions towards more liveable, equitable, and sustainable cities.},

  abstract = {Cities are home to an increasing majority of the world's population. Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

  abstract = {Data collected at large scale and low cost (e.g. satellite and street level imagery) have the potential to substantially improve resolution, spatial coverage, and temporal frequency of measurement of urban inequalities. Multiple types of data from different sources are often available for a given geographic area. Yet, most studies utilize a single type of input data when making measurements due to methodological difficulties in their joint use. We propose two deep learning-based methods for jointly utilizing satellite and street level imagery for measuring urban inequalities. We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9\% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3~m~\texttimes ~3~m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street-level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11\%. We also show examples of prediction maps from both approaches to visually highlight performance differences.},

Car-sharing users' booking slot flexibility is crucial for integration yet remains underexplored. We developed an integrated choice and latent variable model to estimate the value of financial incentives needed for shifting slots and how it is affected by socio-demographics, latent attitudes, trip-level characteristics. We conducted a stated preference survey with car sharing users in Switzerland. The value of time in our sample ranged between 22.4 CHF/h and 35.5 CHF/h (23.5 USD/h and 37.2 USD/h). Older adults, lower income groups, individuals in employment and with a university degree had lower time flexibility. Work, leisure, trips involving others, trips taking place during weekdays and morning peaks were harder to alter. This flexibility has the potential to encourage car-sharing operators and users to engage in V2G initiatives, contributing to decarbonization of transportation and energy systems.},
