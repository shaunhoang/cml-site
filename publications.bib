  abstract = {Traffic congestion across the world has reached chronic levels. Despite many technological disruptions, one of the most fundamental and widely used functions within traffic modelling, the volume delay function, has seen little in the way of change since it was developed in the 1960's. Traditionally macroscopic methods have been employed to relate traffic volume to vehicular journey time. The general nature of these functions enables their ease of use and gives widespread applicability. However, they lack the ability to consider individual road characteristics (i.e. geometry, presence of traffic furniture, road quality and surrounding environment). This research investigates the feasibility to reconstruct the model using two different data sources, namely the traffic speed from Google Maps' Directions Application Programming Interface (API) and traffic volume data from automated traffic counters (ATC). Google's traffic speed data are crowd-sourced from the smartphone Global Positioning System (GPS) of road users, able to reflect real-time, context-specific traffic condition of a road. On the other hand, the ATCs enable the harvesting of the vehicle volume data over equally fine temporal resolutions (hourly or less). By combining them for different road types in London, new context-specific volume-delay functions can be generated. This method shows promise in selected locations with the generation of robust functions. In other locations it highlights the need to better understand other influencing factors, such as the presence of on road parking or weather events.},

Smart cities have responded to these challenges using technology, innovating in the way that public services are delivered to citizens and incorporating participatory governance as a new element in the equation. In this context, new forms of urban governance, such as business improvement districts (BIDs), allow for a closer collaboration between local governments and local agents in the development of initiatives that improve urban liveability. Through analysing best practices, this chapter explores the role of BIDs - public-private partnerships through which businesses invest collectively in the development of local improvements - in the delivery of smart, innovative solutions to reduce the environmental impact of commercial logistics in urban freight. Based on their potential benefits and their international success, the chapter also includes a legal proposal for the implementation of BIDs in Spain.},

  abstract = {Cities are home to an increasing majority of the world's population. Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

  abstract = {Reducing urban inequalities is at the forefront of the global sustainable development agenda, as well as national and local policies. While existing measures of inequality are mostly focused on income and wealth, it is widely recognised that non-monetary disparities such as in health, education, and housing play a crucial role in creating and reinforcing inequalities. Transport plays a central role in mitigating inequalities by enhancing access to employment, education, and essential services. It is also directly and indirectly related to disparities in housing, neighbourhoods, and health. Policymakers increasingly recognize the potential of transport policies in addressing inequalities; however, the effects of interventions need to be understood beyond the transport sector only and should consider wider impacts. In this review, we concentrate on three interlinked sectors -- housing, land-use, and transportation -- where local governments possess some capacity to influence the processes by which inequalities are created and exacerbated. Currently, empirical research on inequalities within these domains is fragmented. Models and datasets used for scenario testing, planning, and intervention evaluation are often disjointed, sector-focused, and rarely consider distributional effects. Our aim is to critically review the literature across different disciplines and perspectives and propose future interdisciplinary directions towards better measurement and modelling of transport-associated inequalities.},

  abstract = {Neighbourhoods are fundamental spatial units to present social phenomena in urban studies. Many studies use administrative boundaries such as census tracts as representations of neighbourhoods, but such boundaries may poorly represent the underlying social structures and physical attributes which might help define more vernacular conceptions and dialectical evolution of these zones. In this paper, using the goal of creating a new set of `Strategic Neighbourhoods' for Transport for London (TfL) as vehicle for analysis, we evaluate two contrasting spatially and socially focused methodologies of neighbourhood generation. In comparing the outputs of a tertiary-communities (T-Communities) method and a combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) cluster analysis method with an earlier iteration of Strategic Neighbourhoods defined by TfL, indices including neighbourhood size, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and the number of community centres are calculated to evaluate their relative performance which demonstrate that both methods create neighbourhood boundaries that can better capture intra-group social homogeneity and are more suitable for analysis than the original SNA boundaries. These results are discussed in the context of the dialectic relationship between neighbourhood outcomes, spatial structures, and social characteristics, leading to more widely relevant conclusions that neighbourhood boundary delineation should combine spatial structure, social attributes, and experimental knowledge to effectively sub-divide urban activity.},
